# Pantheon 

how to run this code:

--> create virtual environment (we love those)
--> --> pip install requirements

create two separate terminals:
--> one in root directory, one in frontend directory
--> in the front end directory terminal: npm install

after setup, to run the code you:
--> in root directory terminal, run: py backend/app.py
--> in the front end directory terminal, run: npm run dev


Demo format:
--> You will be on the main dashboard, this will contain your google analytics 4 traffic acquisition data 
--> there will be a notification to integrate a new data source from hubSpot.
--> integrate the data source and fully integrate your data 
--> wow what a great demo
